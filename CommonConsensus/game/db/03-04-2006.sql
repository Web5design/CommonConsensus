Analogies\n\nTry to force the users to create analogies, being a relationship between four parts:\n\n    a:b :: c:d   : = \"is to\"\n                 :: = \"as\"\n\nFor example\n\n    *table* is-to *eat dinner* as ____ is-to *go swimming*\n\nTo avoid bad prompts, we will only use the analogies we collected in the Original game.  That is, we\'ll bootstrap.\n\nh3. Metaphors\n\nAs mentioned in George Lakoff\'s essay, metaphors may be how people internally represent complex concepts.  By mapping an abstraction to a more concrete domain in a realm of spatial / geogmetric knowledge, you can use the same thought processes to think and talk about these abstract concepts that are otherwise hard to articulate.\n\nExamples of these spatial structures are: containers, paths, obstacles and passages.\n\nWhen people talk of plans, they usually talk of progress as a continuous line between them and their goal, sometimes beset with obstacles.  \n\nPeople talk about love, using metaphors of physical structure: \"I don\'t think we will ever _split up_\", \"Our relationship was _going nowhere_\",  etc. ','dustin','18.250.6.38'),(8,'2005-11-30 20:02:00','2005-11-30 20:02:00','2005-11-30 20:02:00',6,'\nh3. 11.30.05\n\n* Finally got the Feudgame to be stateful (without threading) using an additional table *controls* with the first row containing global data that is reset after each game.\n* Moved site to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:3000\n* Moved wiki (this) to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:2500\n* WordNet, Sparklines, Linguistic tools are all installed, thanks to Mako\'s help.\n* Muliple users can join FeudGame and the player list reflects the current players.\n\nh3. 11.28.05\n\n* *Added* sub-goals can be re-ordered or deleted before they are added.\n* *Fixed* sub-goals are displayed in proper order.','AnonymousCoward','18.250.6.38'),(9,'2005-11-30 20:02:09','2005-11-30 20:02:09','2005-11-30 20:02:09',6,'h3. 11.30.05\n\n* Finally got the Feudgame to be stateful (without threading) using an additional table *controls* with the first row containing global data that is reset after each game.\n* Moved site to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:3000\n* Moved wiki (this) to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:2500\n* WordNet, Sparklines, Linguistic tools are all installed, thanks to Mako\'s help.\n* Muliple users can join FeudGame and the player list reflects the current players.\n\nh3. 11.28.05\n\n* *Added* sub-goals can be re-ordered or deleted before they are added.\n* *Fixed* sub-goals are displayed in proper order.','Dustin','18.250.6.38'),(10,'2005-11-30 20:34:52','2005-11-30 20:34:52','2005-11-30 20:34:52',6,'h3. 11.30.05\n\n* Finally got the FeudGame to be stateful (without threading) using an additional table *controls* with the first row containing global data that is reset after each game.\n* Moved site to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:3000\n* Moved wiki (this) to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:2500\n* WordNet, Sparklines, Linguistic tools are all installed, thanks to Mako\'s help.\n* Muliple users can join FeudGame and the player list reflects the current players.\n\nh3. 11.28.05\n\n* *Added* sub-goals can be re-ordered or deleted before they are added.\n* *Fixed* sub-goals are displayed in proper order.','dustin','18.250.6.38'),(11,'2005-12-11 19:03:47','2005-12-11 19:03:47','2005-12-11 19:03:47',6,'h3. 12.11.05\n\n* User scoring (save scores, rank)\n* Storing data to database\n* Fix IE javascript\n\n\nh3. 11.30.05\n\n* Finally got the FeudGame to be stateful (without threading) using an additional table *controls* with the first row containing global data that is reset after each game.\n* Moved site to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:3000\n* Moved wiki (this) to http://epsilon.media.mit.edu:2500\n* WordNet, Sparklines, Linguistic tools are all installed, thanks to Mako\'s help.\n* Muliple users can join FeudGame and the player list reflects the current players.\n\nh3. 11.28.05\n\n* *Added* sub-goals can be re-ordered or deleted before they are added.\n* *Fixed* sub-goals are displayed in proper order.','Dustin','18.85.16.168'),(12,'2005-12-11 22:49:05','2005-12-11 22:49:05','2005-12-11 22:49:05',6,'h3. 12.11.05\n\n* User scoring (save scores, rank)\n* Guesses are stored into two databases *temp_guesses* and *guesses*.

Itâ€™s the mad-lib style of collecting commonsense knowledge. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 1. Post-Processing Problems\r\n\r\nDuring post-processing (at the back-end), the dataâ€™s fidelity to its structure is important. In the case of OMCS, during the generation of conceptnet, concepts that had modifiers were split into multiple concepts.\r\n\r\n   Gun [isA] Dangerous and deadly weapon\r\n\r\nwould muliply to:\r\n\r\n   Gun [isA] Dangerous and deadly weapon\r\n   Gun [isA] Dangerous weapon\r\n   Gun [isA] Deadly weapon\r\n   Gun [isA] weapon\r\n\r\nWhen this works, it does a good job of light â€˜inferenceâ€™: generalization. But when the data is bad, it magnifies the problem (by multiplying the noise). For example:\r\n\r\n   Marathon [CapableOf] Remind person about ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nAdds the following:\r\n\r\n   Marathon [CapableOf] Remind\r\n   Marathon [CapableOf] Remind person\r\n   Marathon [CapableOf] Remind person about Greece\r\n\r\nIn fact, for something that lacks agency, like a marathon, there should not be any â€œCapableOfâ€? relationships to begin with. There is human subject to this semantic knowledge that ConceptNet? is unaware of. Thus, we have relationships like:\r\n\r\n   Boat [MoativationOf] Not Sink\r\n\r\nWhere it is the people on the boat that have this motivation, not the boat itself. \r\n\r\nh3. 2. Representational Limitations\r\n\r\nOMCS\'s twenty relationships are grouped into 8 (?) sub-types like Affective, Agents, Spatial, and so forth.  Despite this, the concepts within the groups do not always have the data they claim to and often both the nodes and the relations range in granularity.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    Person CapableOf Eat Food\r\n    Person CapalbeOf Having a Seven Course Meal on a Cruise Ship\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. 3. Utility of Corpus\r\n\r\nThe knowledge in OMCS is not encapsulated, so it is unable to isolate context. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, the knowledge cannot be used to reason by analogy, because the inner structures between concepts do not exist.\r\n\r\nh4. 3.1 Analogy Deficiency \r\n\r\nh4. 3.2 Encapsulation\r\n\r\nSpreading activation (one of the main approaches for inference over a large semantic corpus) is problematic for ConceptNet, because at each hop the nodes get (conceptually) further from the original node with no consitstant metric.','Dustin','18.85.16.150'),(68,'2006-02-03 17:51:20','2006-02-03 17:57:22','2006-02-03 17:57:21',9,'h2. %{color:red}To Do%\r\n\r\n* count == number of items in category.  score should refelect the number of unique users who guessed.\r\n\r\n* strip rubbish from input\r\n\r\n\r\n* SemanticParser: POS tagging?\r\n\r\n* Hosting Issues:\r\n# Put on Apache or Lighttpd (tell to ignore .SVN dirs!)\r\n# Get Domain and Sub-Domains:\r\n## dev.x.org => development site, internal access only\r\n## x.org => live site\r\n## wiki.x.org => this wiki\r\n# Launch sites in *init* file.\r\n\r\n\r\n* BootStrapping Knowledge (closing the loop) \r\n\r\n* Better interface: graphics, bars, colours, sensations \r\n# Sparkgraphs!\r\n\r\n* Better Scoring\r\n# Make sure it scores against old results\r\n# Show which users guessed what\r\n# Show which users scored points\r\n# What if top scores 3 and 4 are the same???\r\n\r\n* Reset Goals::goal_used to 0 for all goals each time anew goal is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n* get smtp server up / mailing features working\r\n## send welcome letter\r\n## \"forgot your pass\"\r\n\r\n* statistics to display the results, sparklines, etc\r\n* Interface [one two three] status indicator\r\n* Better documentation and instructions for users\r\n\r\nh2.
